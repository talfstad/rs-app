To get started with front end development:

1. Install Sublime Text Editor, set tab size to 2 and convert tab to spacing

{
  "tab_size": 2,
  "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true
}


Installing Bower and Node dependencies:

1: `bower install`
2: `sudo npm install`

NOTE: These commands will install the appropriate libraries to run the code.


#### Running the app

Run Distribution version:
  `sudo grunt build`
  `sudo grunt serve`


  you will now have a server running on port 9000 that is connected to our db 
  if it launches as a 404 just refresh the page
